 A simple implementation of a deep learning library written in python with the subtle help of numpy (may the np be with you).

    - Features
        - MSE (Mean Squared Error) Loss Function.
        - SGD (Schocastic Gradient) Optimization Function.
        - Batch Iterator
        - Neural Network Class.

    * Prerequisite:
        - Intall numpy `pip install numpy`
    
    * Run example:
    * python `example.py`
